### Procedure

Welcome to Experiment 3: DES Decryption Simulator! Building on the foundation established in Experiments 1 and 2, this module delves deeper into the DES algorithm, focusing on the decryption process of ciphertext.

→ Begin by inputting a 64-bit binary sequence, representing your ciphertext, and the associated Decryption Key. Once entered, click "Next" to initiate the decryption. The data, for ease of understanding, is showcased as a matrix.

→ Use the "next" and "previous" buttons to maneuver through each decryption round. Observe the intricacies of operations on both the left and right 32 bits as the ciphertext undergoes transformation.

→ After progressing through the initial k rounds, test your understanding by computing the k+1th intermediate decryption result. Succeeding in this task will grant you access to the subsequent stages of the simulation.

→ Stumble upon an error? The simulator stands ready with feedback, guiding you towards the right path. The "PREVIOUS" button allows for a swift backtrack to refine your understanding.

→ The culmination of this experiment hinges on your ability to discern the final 32-bit left and right decrypted outputs.

→ To Complete this Experiment the student has to identify the 32-bit left and right output

Tip: Keeping a technical journal on hand can be invaluable. Jot down observations, insights, and potential questions. This interactive journey is designed not just to demonstrate but to instill a profound understanding of the DES decryption mechanics. Engage deeply to unlock the nuances
