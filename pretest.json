      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The round function application comes after the initial permutation.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The final permutation is the last step in the encryption process, not the first in decryption.",
        "c": "Correct. The inverse initial permutation is the first step in DES decryption.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Key generation is not a step in the decryption process; it precedes encryption and decryption."

      "question": "Which keys are used first in the process of DES decryption?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The first round keys",
        "b": "The last round keys",
        "c": "All keys at once",
        "d": "No keys are used"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. During decryption, DES does not use the first round keys first.",
        "b": "Correct. In DES decryption, the process starts with the last (16th) round keys.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Keys are used one at a time per round, not all at once.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Keys are essential for the DES decryption process."
