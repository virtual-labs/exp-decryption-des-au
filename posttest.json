      "question": "In DES decryption, what happens after the 16 rounds of processing?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Initial permutation",
        "b": "Final permutation",
        "c": "Inverse initial permutation",
        "d": "Subkeys are generated"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. The initial permutation is the first step in encryption, not the last step in decryption.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The final permutation is part of the encryption process.",
        "c": "Correct. After the 16 rounds of decryption, the inverse initial permutation is applied.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Subkey generation occurs before encryption and decryption processes."

    {
      "question": "If a ciphertext block is decrypted with DES using the wrong key, what is the result?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The original plaintext with some errors",
        "b": "An easily correctable piece of plaintext",
        "c": "A completely different and random plaintext",
        "d": "The ciphertext remains unchanged"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Using the wrong key does not yield the original plaintext, even with errors.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The incorrect plaintext is not easily correctable as it is essentially random.",
        "c": "Correct. Using the wrong key in DES decryption results in a random and meaningless output.",
        "d": "Incorrect. The ciphertext does change, but the output is random and not the original plaintext."

      "correctAnswer": "c",
